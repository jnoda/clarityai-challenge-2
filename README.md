# Clarity - Backend code challenge

This challenge is meant to test your software development skills.

You have 24 hours to reply with your answer, but we expect these challenges to take no more than 3 hours. We donâ€™t take into account how
long it takes for you to respond, ie 2 hours or 22 hours are considered equal. Your answer will be evaluated based on:

* Correctness, does it work?
* Is it tested?
* Is it well-designed?
* Would this code be easy to extend or maintain?
* Is the code easy to comprehend?
* Performs well?
* Is the code efficient resource-wise?

We want to see your programming skills, avoid the use of frameworks like Spring Boot, Spring, Spark, etc, it is not needed to solve the
problem. You should avoid using any libraries or frameworks except for the language standard library. Also, please feel free to consult any
relevant documentation.

Think in Clean Code, Clean Architecture, Testing and simple solutions that works!!

Also, be sure you send something that we can compile and test easily.

## Challenge 2: Object Model with Java Classes

It is required to develop an application for a restaurant. In particular, we need you to **create the set of DTO java classes** of the
application.

### Requirements

The application should take care of the available meals, their price and taxes. The restaurant can have different types of offers like a
daily menu, weekend menu or happy hour. The manager of the restaurant should be able to see detailed information about the items sold, like
item cost, tax, quantity, etc.

Design an Object Model with Java Classes for this application that:

1. Allows managing orders: order meals, drinks, menus, mark orders as paid, generate bills, etc.
2. Provides real time control of the stock: when the restaurant runs out of a specific meal, refill stock, etc.
3. Provides aggregated data (i.e. weekly) of the restaurant accountability: aggregated revenue, costs, Taxes, offers ratio, etc.

Try to be as detailed as possible with each requirement. Requirements are presented by priority. Make sure you've got a good design for one
of the requirements before starting with the next one. We would prefer 2 points well-designed over having a soluition for all of them but
unfinished.

Please focus on the software design rather than the high level architecture, but if you feel like (and have time), a small description of
your architecture proposal will always be welcomed.

Please feel free to make assumptions as necessary with the proper documentation.

Good luck !!!
